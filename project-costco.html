                        Grocery shopping is no longer the mundane chore; it’s a reason to leave the house 
                        and feel "normal". However, given the widespread of the COVID-19, people shop taking extreme safety 
                        precautions while carrying doubt in other shoppers’ ability to do the same. <br><br>
                        This doubt coupled with invisible rules, such as checking out quickly to prevent the hold up of lines,
                        causes anxiety in shoppers. A key subset of the individuals described are Costco 
                        visitors, who are often concerned by the wholesale market’s large number of visitors.

                        of questions to ask our interviewees, but these questions mainly served as guides 
                        for them to tell their journey rather than the standard question-and-answer interview.

                        We ideated a web app that allows customers to first scan their items, showing the 
                        item's price and the updated total, before putting them into their cart. It will also
                        allow customers to edit/remove items in their cart and app accordingly. <br><br>
                        This design can alleviate the social pressure during the checkout process as the shoppers
                        can see the details about and make necessary adjustments to their carts before they reach the cash register. <br><br>
                        To make this program inclusive and accessible for the middle-aged and elderly shoppers, we designed 
                        this web app to be responsive and adaptable on tablets, a larger screen, as well.

                            The split-screen view allows the user to add items on the left and

                            With the larger real estate of tablets, the split-screen 
                            structure would be convenient for the users and allow them shop more consciously 
                            (i.e. visually show when they are approaching or exceeding their budget)

                            We found that Costco carries a ton of variations for similar items, so having a fully 
                            collapsible cart would be a better utilization of the full tablet screen.

                            For users who enjoy browsing and getting a preview of the available options, this design 
                            offers them a quick and easy solution to view a larger selection.

                            This current design confused the user as he thought swiping through would change to another 
                            card instead of changing payment method. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We decided to converge our phone design to our tablet version where we have two icons 
                            indicating what option to choose. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To make the flow more complete, we also decided to present customers to view their entire 
                            receipt before paying as we believe that this is a way of mitigating error prevention.

                        If this project were to be continued, we would definitely plan for more user testings with actual Costco customers and recruit
                        different ages of users. Additionally, we would aim to make the tested prototypes more interactive to better understand how 
                        clear and effective our designs are.<br><br>

                        To supplement the feedback and results from the user testings, we would also like to launch surveys to see what current customers 
                        envision to be their ideal shopping experiences and understand how our solution can help enhance their customer journey at Costco.
